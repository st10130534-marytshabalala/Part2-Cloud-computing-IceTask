            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                KhumaloCraft Emporium, led by James Khumalo, promises to revolutionize the showing and sale of handcrafted
                products via a global e-commerce platform. To realize this vision, a thorough comparison of their present
                workflow to the suggested solution is required.

            <h2>Comparison of Current Workflow with Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, KhumaloCraft may use traditional means to showcase and sell handcrafted products, such as
                physical stores or a small online presence/local spaza shop. The proposed solution proposes a scalable,
                accessible, and user-friendly e-commerce platform that can serve a global audience. This change offers a
                substantial improvement over the current approach, allowing KhumaloCraft to reach a larger audience and
                streamline their sales process.

            <h2>Benefits of Using Cloud Computing</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud computing provides various benefits to KhumaloCraft Emporium. For starters, it offers scalability,
                allowing the platform to grow easily without requiring considerable infrastructure expenditure.
                Furthermore, cloud computing ensures accessibility, allowing clients worldwide to readily access the
                site. Furthermore, it is cost-effective, as KhumaloCraft just pays for the resources used, avoiding
                upfront infrastructure costs.

            <h2>Scalability</h2>
            <p>
                Scalability is one of the most significant advantages of cloud computing. Traditional infrastructure
                frequently necessitates large initial expenditure to allow anticipated growth. KhumaloCraft uses cloud
                computing to scale resources up or down based on demand, guaranteeing that the platform can handle
                traffic spikes at peak hours without incurring needless costs during quieter periods.

                Customers from all around the world can use cloud-hosted solutions to access the platform with only an
                internet connection. This accessibility broadens KhumaloCraft's potential consumer base and removes
